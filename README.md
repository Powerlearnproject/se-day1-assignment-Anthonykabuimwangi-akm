#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry. 
Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles, methods, and tools to the development and maintenance of high-quality software systems. Software engineering enables the creation of software applications and systems that power various aspects of modern life, including communication, commerce, entertainment, and healthcare.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1. Development of Programming Languages (1950s-1970s) - The creation of Fortran in 1957, one of the first high-level languages, allowed easier programming for scientists. The development of C in the 1970s further advanced software with its portability, laying the foundation for modern languages and systems.

2. Establishment of Software Engineering (1960s) - The late 1960s marked the beginning of software engineering as a formal discipline, aiming to apply engineering principles to software development, highlighted by the 1968 NATO conference.

3. Rise of Agile Methodologies (2000s) - Agile methodologies, emerging in the 2000s, emphasized flexibility and customer collaboration, leading to a shift from traditional models like Waterfall to more adaptive, iterative approaches such as Scrum.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
A). Requirements: Involves gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements. B). Design: Involves creating high-level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface. C). Implementation: Involves writing code and building the software according to the design specifications. D). Testing: Involves conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements. E). Deployment: Involves releasing the software to users or customers. F). Maintenance: Involves providing ongoing support, updates, and enhancements to the software after deployment.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
The Waterfall methodology is sequential in nature and it requires each phase to be completed before moving on to the next. It is well-suited for projects with clearly defined requirements and minimal changes. On the other hand, Agile adopts an iterative approach, breaking down development into smaller sprints. This flexibility allows for adapting to changing requirements and incorporating frequent feedback from stakeholders. Agile is particularly effective for complex projects that require rapid delivery and adaptability.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
A Software Developer is responsible for writing code and implementing software solutions. A Quality Assurance Engineer ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans. A Project Manager Oversees the planning, execution, and delivery of software projects.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Integrated Development Environments helps in providing comprehensive tools for writing, debugging, and testing code, Examples include Visual Studio, Eclipse, and IntelliJ IDEA Version Control Systems helps in tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among team members. They include Git, and Subversion.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Provide strategies to overcome these challenges. The challenges include changing requirements,tight deadlines and technical debt. Strategies to overcome thses challenges include effective communication, agile methodologies, prioritization of tasks, and regular reassessment of project goals and timelines.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit Testing is used in testing individual components or modules of software. Integration Testing is used in testing interactions between different components or subsystems. System Testing is used in testing the entire software system as a whole. Acceptance Testing is used in testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs. They help identify and fix defects early in the development process, leading to higher-quality software products.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is all about crafting questions or statements to get the best possible responses from AI models. Prompt engineering helps avoid getting confusing responses from an AI model by making the questions clear and specific, so the AI understands exactly what one need.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Example of a vague prompt - Tell me about dogs Example of a more clear, specific and concise prompt - tell me about the history of german shepherd dogs. The improved prompt is more effective as it is more specific
